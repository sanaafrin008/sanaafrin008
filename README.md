# Hi, I'm Sana Afrin 👋

**Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer** — I build end-to-end ML projects: Data → Model → API → UI. Currently focused on reproducible ML projects and production demos.

- 🔭 Building: end-to-end ML projects with deployment (Streamlit/FastAPI)
- 🌱 Learning: Transformers, MLOps (Docker, CI/CD, AWS), and scalable model deployment
- 👯 Open to: ML internships / entry-level ML roles
- 📫 Contact: sanaafrin049@example.com ·

## 🛠️ Skills & Tech
Python · pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · PyTorch/TensorFlow (learning) · Streamlit · FastAPI · Git · Docker · SQL · Linux

---

## 🔎 Quick note
I cleanly separate projects — one project per repo — with README, minimal requirements, and at least one runnable demo (Streamlit or CLI). If something is small or duplicated I archive it.
