# Hi, I'm Sana Afrin 👋

**Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer** — I build end-to-end ML projects: Data → Model → API → UI. Currently focused on reproducible ML projects and production demos.

- 🔭 Building: end-to-end ML projects with deployment (Streamlit/FastAPI)
- 🌱 Learning: Transformers, MLOps (Docker, CI/CD, AWS), and scalable model deployment
- 👯 Open to: ML internships / entry-level ML roles
- 📫 Contact: your-email@example.com · LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin

## 🚀 Pinned projects
- **[house-price-predictor](https://github.com/sanaafrin008/house-price-predictor)** — End-to-end ML pipeline + Streamlit demo (RandomForest baseline).  
- **[project-foodorderingsystem](https://github.com/sanaafrin008/project-foodorderingsystem)** — Web app prototype (frontend + backend).  
- **[fmml-examples](https://github.com/sanaafrin008/fmml-examples)** — Cleaned FMML lab notebooks split into focused projects.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tech
Python · pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · PyTorch/TensorFlow (learning) · Streamlit · FastAPI · Git · Docker · SQL · Linux

## 📂 How to explore my work
1. Click pinned projects above to see the project README, demo link (if deployed), and code.  
2. Each project has:
   - `README.md` with Quickstart
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `train.py` / `predict.py` or `app/` for demos
   - Link to a short demo (Streamlit / HuggingFace / Render)

---

## 🔎 Quick note
I cleanly separate projects — one project per repo — with README, minimal requirements, and at least one runnable demo (Streamlit or CLI). If something is small or duplicated I archive it.
